# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game I'm doing as a personal project to learn Python programming. 

I want to put in a graphical interface. I could do this with turtle, but I haven't decided if that's the route I want to go. I also intend to put in a menu so that the computer asks if the user wants to go first and if the user wants to play X's or O's.

I also want to introduce levels of difficulty. Currently, the computer plays randomly. Eventually I'll make it so the computer asks how hard to make the game and can the uses different levels of strategy: attempting to get 3 in a row, blocking when the user gets 2 in a row, attempting to fork the user.
